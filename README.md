# car_price_model_
Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict second-hand car prices, improving accuracy over traditional methods.
Utilized data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling, encoding, and imputation to enhance model performance.
Employed various algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods to identify the most effective approach for price prediction.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features influencing car prices, such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
Achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and optimizing model parameters through cross-validation.
Integrated data from multiple sources, including historical sales data and car specifications, to build a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluation.
Implemented performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to evaluate and validate model effectiveness.
Created visualizations and reports to communicate model insights and predictions to stakeholders, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
Deployed the trained model into a web application or tool for real-time price prediction, enhancing user accessibility and functionality.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data engineers and domain experts, to refine model requirements and ensure alignment with business objectives.
